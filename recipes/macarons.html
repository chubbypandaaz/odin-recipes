        <p>A popular French cookie, macarons (not to be confused with macaroons) are delightfully crisp on the outside and 
            soft and chewy on the inside. Recognizable by their smooth round top, little feet around the circumference, 
            sandwiching just enough cream between two cookies, macarons are irresistible to many.
            With countless flavor combinations and infinite design possibilities, there is a macaron fit for everyone!</p>
