        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A popular French cookie, macarons (not to be confused with macaroons) are delightfully crisp on the outside and 
            soft and chewy on the inside. Recognizable by their smooth round top, little feet around the circumference, 
            sandwiching just enough cream between two cookies, macarons are irresistible to many.
            With countless flavor combinations and infinite design possibilities, there is a macaron fit for everyone!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat</li>
                <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted 
                    with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar 
                    and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
                <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; 
                    quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, about 30 strokes.</li>
                <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner 
                    cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, 
                    onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of 
                    flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
                <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into 
                    a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in 
                    rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature 
                    until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes.</li>
                
            </ol>
