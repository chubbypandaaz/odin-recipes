                <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
                <li>1.25 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 pound marscarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
                <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan 
                    until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, 
                    stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
                <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, 
                    then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a 
                    medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the 
                    refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
                <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split 
                    ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.</li>
                <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of 
                    a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over 
                    the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. 
                    Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
